# ZillowProject

# Given an individual agent ‘speaks’ to Zillow through a variety of marketing and sales channels before purchasing advertising, how much ‘credit’ should be assigned to each type of interaction (inclusive of marketing and sales)?  What’s the associated ROI of spend on marketing & sales?

# How should Zillow apply these findings?  Do you have any suggestions for how Zillow may change the allocation of their advertising dollars or sales floor involvement?

# With more time and resources, how would you make this smarketing analysis better?
